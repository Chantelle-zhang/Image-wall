# Image-wall

This is an object oriented image wall component  .you can pass parameters to generate an image wall with customized image height,width,rows,collums.just like this:
var imgwall=new Imgwall($("#container"), {
		imgArr: imgArr1,
		imgWidth: 160,
		imgHeight: 160,
		rows: 2,
		cols: 4
	});

you can drag and drop the images to change the orders , or can click the 'image rearrange' button to automaticaly reorder the images.

there is a little bug under safari browers still waiting to be solved ,so please test with chrome and firefox first.

I am a new programmer so i am still learning to improve my code.
